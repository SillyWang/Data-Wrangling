    "These two competing effects cancel out to give them low weights,\n",

    "## 4. Extracting Other Features\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for most text analysis tasks to treat documents as bags-of-words, which can significantly simplify the inference procedure of text analysis algorithms. \n",
    "However, things always have pros and cons. \n",
    "The bag-of-words representation loses lots of information encoded in either syntax or word order (i.e., dependencies between adjacent words in sentences.). \n",
    "For example, representing a document as a collection of unigrams effectively disregards any word order dependence,\n",
    "which fails to capture phrases and multi-word expressions. A similar issue has been mentioned in section 2.1. of Chapter 2. \n",
    "In this section, we are going to show you how to\n",
    "* use Part-of-Speeching (POS) tagging to extract specific word groups, such as all nouns, verbs, etc.,\n",
    "* extract n-grams,\n",
    "*  and extract collocations\n",
    "\n",
    "These features can be further used to enrich the representation of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Extracting Nouns and Verbs\n",
    "It is easy for human to tell the difference between nouns, verbs, \n",
    "adjectives and adverbs, as we have learnt them back in elementary school.\n",
    "However, how can we automatically classify words into their parts of speech (i.e., lexical categories or word classes) \n",
    "and label them accordingly with computer program? \n",
    "This section is not going to discuss how to determine the category of a word from a linguistic perspective.\n",
    "Instead it demonstrates the use of some existing POS taggers to extract words in a specific lexical category.\n",
    "It has been proven that words together with their part-of-speech (POS) are quite useful for many language processing tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, the process of labelling words with their corresponding part-of-speech (POS) tags is known as [POS tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging).\n",
    "A POS tagger processes a sequence of words and attaches a POS tag to each word based on both its definition and its context. There are many POS taggers available online, such as [Sandford POS tagger](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml). \n",
